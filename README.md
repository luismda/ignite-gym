## About

Ignite Gym is a mobile app with lots of gym exercises, separated by muscle group, with instructions on how to do them. 

In addition, you can mark a exercise as completed and view all completed exercises in history, grouped by day. In the application, it is possible to create a new account and log in, as well as edit your profile, as well as update your avatar.

This app uses a refresh token strategy to keep the user signed in and the auth flow uses a JWT.

The project was developed using these technologies:

- TypeScript
- React Native
- Expo Dev Client
- Expo Image Picker (*used to select and edit user avatar*)
- NativeBase (*component library*)
- React Navigation (*stack and tab navigation*)
- Axios (*HTTP client*)
- Async Storage (*used to local storage of user and token*)
- One Signal (*used to send push notifications*)
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (*used with One Signal to send notifications on Android devices*)
- React Hook Form
- Zod

Finally, this project was developed in the React Native training in the [**Rocketseat**](https://github.com/rocketseat-education) **Ignite** course. The main purpose of this app was to practice using a **component library, such as NativeBase, and bottom tab navigation, as well as backend integration, with authentication flow**. In addition, it was possible to practice using the **Context API and React Hooks**, always following good coding practices.

The **push notification strategy** was also implemented to remind the user to practice or even notify about a new exercise. Additionally, **deep linking** was also implemented to redirect based on notifications.
